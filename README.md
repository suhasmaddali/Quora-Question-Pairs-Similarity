## Introduction

The problem is about identifying whether a given question already exists in the repository of questions asked in quora. If the given question is similar __semantically__ and the meaning, the __machine learning algorithms__ must accurately identify whether the questions are duplicate of one another. 

In __Quora__, we find that a lot of people ask questions every second. It is important that proper steps are taken to remove questions that are similar to the previously asked questions. If a similar question is asked with a change in wording, it would be appropriate to attach answers of the previously asked question that was similar to this question. This would save a lot of time and memory space on the part of Quora and minimize its expenses.

In this project, various new features were created. In the data, only the two texts and whether the question is a duplicate or not is given. We have to create new features that would help us in machine learning predictions. Features such as common words between questions, number of important words and other features were considered. 

## 👉 Directions to download the repository and run the notebook 

This is for the Washington Bike Demand Prediction repository. But the same steps could be followed for this repository. 

1. You'll have to download and install Git that could be used for cloning the repositories that are present. The link to download Git is https://git-scm.com/downloads.

2. Once "Git" is downloaded and installed, you'll have to right-click on the location where you would like to download this repository. I would like to store it in "Git Folder" location.

3. If you have successfully installed Git, you'll get an option called "Gitbash Here" when you right-click on a particular location.

4. Once the Gitbash terminal opens, you'll need to write "Git clone" and then paste the link of the repository.

5. The link of the repository can be found when you click on "Code" (Green button) and then, there would be a html link just below. Therefore, the command to download a particular repository should be "Git clone html" where the html is replaced by the link to this repository.
