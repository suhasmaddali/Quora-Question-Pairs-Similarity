# Quora-Question-Pairs-Similarity
The problem is about identifying whether a given question already exists in the repository of questions asked in quora. If the given question is similar semantically and the meaning, the machine learning algorithms must accurately identify whether the questions are duplicate of one another. 

In Quora, we find that a lot of people ask questions every second. It is important that proper steps are taken to remove questions that are similar to the previously asked questions. If a similar question is asked with a change in wording, it would be appropriate to attach answers of the previously asked question that was similar to this question. This would save a lot of time and memory space on the part of Quora and minimize its expenses.
