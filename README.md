# ⁉️ Quora Question Pair Similarity

The problem is about identifying whether a given question already exists in the repository of questions asked in quora. If the given question is similar semantically and the meaning, the machine learning algorithms must accurately identify whether the questions are duplicate of one another.

In Quora, we find that a lot of people ask questions every second. It is important that proper steps are taken to remove questions that are similar to the previously asked questions. If a similar question is asked with a change in wording, it would be appropriate to attach answers of the previously asked question that was similar to this question. This would save a lot of time and memory space on the part of Quora and minimize its expenses. 

In this project, various new features were created. In the data, only the two texts and whether the question is a duplicate or not is given. We have to create new features that would help us in machine learning predictions. Features such as common words between questions, number of important words and other features were considered. 

## Directions to run the Ipython notebook 

1. You'll have to download and install Git that could be used for cloning the repositories that are present. The link to download Git is https://git-scm.com/downloads.
2. Once the Git is downloaded and installed, you'll have to right-click on the location where you would like to add the files or the repository. 
3. You'll have to click on "Gitbash here" that would be opened when you right click on a particular location. 
4. One the Gitbash terminal opens, you'll need to write "Git clone" and then copy the clipboard file that is present when you click on Code in Github. The link must be pasted and run so that the files would be downloaded at the location of interest. 
5. Later, you'll need to use Anaconda Prompt and add "Jupyter notebook" in the prompt. 
6. This would open the jupyter notebook that could be used to run and load the .ipynb files respectively. Therefore, you would be able to run the project at hand.
